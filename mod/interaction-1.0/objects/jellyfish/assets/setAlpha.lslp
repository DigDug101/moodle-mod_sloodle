*  DESCRIPTION
*  This script will send messages to waiting quizServers.  When a player enters the game, this router
*  sends a message to all listening quizServers asking if anyone is available.
*  The quiz servers will report if they are AVAILABLE or BUSY.
*  The router will select an available quizServer and then send that quizServer the id of the player.
