  This script receives requests from SLOODLE_CHANNEL_QUIZ_ASK_QUESTION_DIALOG linked message channel, and passes it along to 6 sloodle_quiz_question_handler scripts in waiting
  After it passes it along, it marks that script as busy, until that script notifies the router it is free again for work.  I created this to help spead up the response time of 
  http requests
